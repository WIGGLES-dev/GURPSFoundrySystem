The easiest way to get in touch with me is on the GURPS discord server handle WIGGLES#9429.

## Bug Reports
If you encounter a bug please report the issue to me on the [project github page](https://github.com/WIGGLES-dev/GURPSFoundrySystem).

## Limitations

### GCS Importing
* Cannot load nested data structure, GCS lists will be flattened and containers will retain their container status.
* Modifiers have not been implemented yet, therefore some traits and equipment may not reflect their values as they do in GCS.
* Not all features have been implemented, the only ones currently available are skill bonuses and attribute bonuses.

## Know Devops?
If you are familiar with web technologies I appreciate all the help I can get. The project is written mainly in TypeScript and uses Svelte to render UI components. Most of the GURPS related logic has been extracted [into my g4elogic NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/g4elogic?activeTab=readme).

### Current Contributors
